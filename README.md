## üé≠ Masks

The masks add conditions to blocks to be modified when other commands are used.

`/function _pig:mask.add.raw {raw:__}`: Add a custom mask

* For example `/function _pig:mask.add.raw {raw:"entity @e[type=pig,distance=..3]"}` creates a mask that filter the blocks near to a pig

`/function _pig:mask.negate.last`: Negate the last mask (The negation of a mask filter all the block that wasn't filtered by the previous mask)

`/function _pig:mask.negate.n {n:__}`: Negate the mask at the position `n`

`/function _pig:mask.remove.n {n:__}`: Remove the mask at the position `n`

## üé® Patterns

The matterns allow place random mix of a weighted list of blocks.

Patterns effects on the commands with the symbol ‚ü®üé®‚ü©.

A pattern is an item, and you have to select it (instead of a basic block) in your main hand to use it.

A filled shulker box works like a pattern (where the Counts of each item is the weight). It's also works with any block with `tag.BlockEntityTag.Items` (like chests or barrel "+NBT")

You can also turn any item into a pattern. Place a filled container (as explained just above) is your offhand and any item in your main hand, then use the command `/function _pig:pattern` to turn the item (in the mainhand) into a pattern (with the content of the container).
